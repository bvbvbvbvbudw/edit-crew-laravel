                <h4>Section 3 – Disclosure</h4>
                <p>We may disclose your personal information if we are required by law to do so or if you violate our Terms of
                    Service.</p>
                <h4>Section 4 - Web Hosting</h4>

                </p>
                <h4>Section 5 - Third-Party Services</h4>
                <p>In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to the
                    extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.</p>
                <p>However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction
                    processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to them
                    for your purchase-related transactions.</p>
                <p>For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in
                    which your personal information will be handled by these providers.</p>
                <p>In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located in a
                    different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the
                    services of a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the
                    jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located.</p>
                <p>As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment gateway located in
                    the United States, then your personal information used in completing that transaction may be subject to
                    disclosure under United States legislation, including the Patriot Act.</p>
                <p>Once you leave our store’s website or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no

                    make sure it is not inappropriately lost, misused, accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed.</p>
                <p>If you provide us with your credit card information, the information is encrypted using secure socket layer
                    technology (SSL) and stored with encryption. Although no method of transmission over the Internet or
                    electronic storage is 100% secure, we follow all PCI-DSS requirements and implement additional generally

                <p>If our store is acquired or merged with another company, your information may be transferred to the new
                    owners so that we may continue to sell products to you.</p>
