                <p>Studio Salmon LLC (doing business as “Edit Crew”) reserves the right to change or modify this Agreement, and
                    any policy or guideline incorporated by reference at any time at its sole discretion.</p>
                <p>You (referred to as “Customer”) accept our Terms of Service, detailed herein, upon clicking the checkbox in
                    our checkout process (which is required to complete the form). You agree that you’ve reviewed and understand
                    the content within our knowledge base outlining details on how our service works and our scope: <a
                        href="{{ route('page.scope') }}" target="_blank">https://www.editcrew.com/scope</a></p>
                <p>Any changes or modification will be posted by Edit Crew to <a
                        href="{{ route('page.terms') }}">www.editcrew.com/terms-conditions</a> and become effective upon posting of the
                    revisions on this document.</p>
                <p>You are responsible for regularly reviewing the Site to obtain timely notice of such changes or
                    modifications. Your continued use of the Services following Edit Crew posting of any changes or modifications
                    will constitute your acceptance of such changes or modifications. If you do not agree to the terms of any
                    modification, do not continue to use the services and immediately provide notice of cancellation of this
                    agreement.</p>
                <p><strong>Cancellation</strong> – You may cancel your subscription with Edit Crew at any time, however, it must
                    be 5 business days before the end of the then-current subscription period. You can cancel your subscription in
                    the client portal at any time, or write to the Success Manager.</p>
                <p><strong>Use </strong>– Your subscription and any add-ons will automatically renew at the end of the
                    applicable subscription period. Turnaround times are not guaranteed, but a majority of our customers get a
                    first draft within 1-2 business days, and revised drafts within 24 hours. Unused hours in a subscription do
                    not carry over to the next period.</p>
                <p>Upon cancellation, you will continue to have access to the Edit Crew services and your files through the end
                    of your paid billing term. Access to your account files requires an active subscription. Cancelled accounts
                    will not have access to their files once their billing term has ended.</p>
                <p>After 45 days of no editing activity on an order, Edit Crew reserves the right to delete the files, media,
                    and related assets associated with the order from our servers and on the storage of Frame.io.</p>
                <p><strong>Money Back Guarantee</strong> – We strive to ensure your satisfaction with our services, offering a
                    14-day refund period from the date of subscription for new customers. At our discretion, we reserve the right
                    to deny refund requests in cases of suspected fraud, refund abuse, or other manipulative behaviors. If you are
                    using Edit Crew for the first time and wish to request a refund, please do so by emailing or messaging your
                    project manager in the client portal, or by sending an email to success@editcrew.com.</p>
                <p><strong>Refund Processing Fee</strong>: A nominal processing fee will be applied to refund requests made
                    within the 14-day period. The purpose of this fee is to account for administrative costs involved in handling
                    refund procedures.</p>
                <p><strong>Currency Exchange</strong>: Charges and refunds are dependent on the exchange rate between the US
                    Dollar and your currency for the day.</p>
                <p>We value your trust in Edit Crew and are committed to providing you with exceptional service. If you have any
                    questions or concerns regarding our refund policy, feel free to contact us at success@editcrew.com.</p>
                <p><strong>Payment and Refunds</strong> – Payments are non-refundable and we do not provide refunds or credits
                    for any partial subscription periods except as provided for in the 14-day satisfaction guarantee. You further
                    agree that, upon registering for the services through the Site, you authorize Edit Crew to charge your method
                    of payment (e.g. credit card or Paypal) for the fee on each anniversary of your registration date, based upon
                    your billing frequency (e.g. monthly, quarterly, annually). Your account and access to the services provided
                    via the site may be suspended in the event of non-payment of applicable fees. You represent and warrant to
                    Edit Crew that such payment information is accurate and that you are authorized to use the payment instrument.
                    You will promptly update your account information with any changes (for example, a change in your billing
                    address or credit card expiration date) that may occur.  Edit Crew may change its fees from time to time by
                    posting the changes on the Site with 5 days prior notice, but with no advance notice required for temporary
                    promotions or reductions in fees. You, the customer, are responsible to use Edit Crew after payment.</p>

                    or company. The Essentials plan is not meant to replace a full-time, on-staff video editor. If we find that
                    you are not in alignment with our model, sharing accounts/logins, violate our core values, or are abusing our
                    services or team in any way, including using our services for illegal or adult/pornographic materials, we
                    reserve the right to cancel your account.</p>
                <p><strong>Output files</strong> – While we do our best to minimize any mistakes, due to the nature of creative
                    design we can not guarantee all files delivered will be 100% error free. Upon file delivery you agree to
                    review and proof all files for any errors or omissions and notify our team if any changes/corrections are
                    needed. We will do our best to rush any edits to correct the mistakes. Edit Crew is not responsible or liable

                <p>By default, you agree to provide Edit Crew with a non-exclusive right and license to publish your work in our
                    portfolio, website logo block, social media, email, internal communication channels, for purposes of internal
                    training, or other communication efforts. If you would like to revoke this right, please notify our team in
                    writing at success@editcrew.com.</p>
                <p><strong>Work and delivery output</strong> – While we can accept unlimited requests and revisions, our output
                    volume depends on many factors, namely depending on the total request volume and complexity. We do our best to
                    work with you to accommodate any priority items and your timelines. That being said, our suggestion is to not
                    use our service for time sensitive requests.  Your right to use the Edit Crew services shall terminate upon
                    your breach of any term of this Agreement.</p>

                <p><strong>Subtitling – </strong>The Customer understands and accepts 99% accuracy on all intelligible audio.

                    any employee/contractor of Edit Crew, business associates, subcontractors, parent companies, or any person who
                    was associated with any such groups listed above at any time, would be harmful and damaging to Edit Crew. It
                    is agreed that during your term of engagement with Edit Crew and for a period of five years ceasing the end of
                    the engagement, that you shall not, in any way, directly or indirectly prompt or attempt to prompt any

                    information about competitive employment to any of Edit Crew’s employees/contractors, or solicit, persuade, or
                    hire away any employee/contractor of Edit Crew with the intention of an employment opportunity that may or may
                    not be in competition with the employer.</p>
                <p><strong>Limitation of liability</strong> – We will not be liable to you or any third party in any event for
